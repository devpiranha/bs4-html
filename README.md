# Junior Developer Project

We would like you to create a Simple 2 Page HTML website of your choice, Could be about yourself, A game, movie etcâ€¦ ( I have attached some screenshots of some examples )

Needs to be built in HTML and CSS. And have a Basic HTML form on. 
(Name, Email, Messages, This Doesn't need to send anywhere ) 

**Page 1** - Home Page

**Page 2** - Contact Page with a form.

Feel free to include a framework such as Bootstrap -  There is lots of information about this online example - w3schools

## Bonus points,

Make it Mobile Friendly with media query's

Add some JavaScript. Could be a number counter or a modal or an accordion. Lots of options.

Embed a Google Map

 But most importantly just give it a go, and have fun. :D
